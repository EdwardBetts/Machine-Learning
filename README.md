# Machine-Learning

This is the my study notes on [Machine Learning class in Stanford](http://cs229.stanford.edu/). I will use Python to implement the basic ML algorithms.

## Algorithms

#### 1. Supervised Learning
* Linear Regression ([data: spambasing](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase))
- Linear Batch Gradient Descent
- Linear Stochastic Gradient Descent

* Logistic Regression ([data: spambasing](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase))
- Logistic Batch Gradient Descent
- Logistic Stochastic Gradient Descent
