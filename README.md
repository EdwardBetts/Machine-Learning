# Machine-Learning

This is the my study notes on [Machine Learning class in Stanford](http://cs229.stanford.edu/). I will use Python to implement the basic ML algorithms.

## Algorithms

#### 1. Supervised Learning
* Batch Gradient Descent ([housing data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing))
* Stochastic Gradient Descent
