# Machine-Learning

This is the study notes on [Machine Learning class in Stanford](http://cs229.stanford.edu/). Use Python to implement the basic ML algorithms.

## Algorithms

#### 1. Supervised Learning
* Linear Regression ([data: spambase](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase))
	- Linear Batch Gradient Descent
	- Linear Stochastic Gradient Descent

* Logistic Regression ([data: spambase](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase))
	- Logistic Batch Gradient Descent
	- Logistic Stochastic Gradient Descent
    - Smooth Stochastic Gradient Descent ([Ref: Machine Learning in Action(stocGradAscent1)](https://github.com/pbharrin/machinelearninginaction/blob/master/Ch05/logRegres.py))
